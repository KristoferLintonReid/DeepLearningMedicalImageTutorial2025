## How to Use This Repository

1. **Run the notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**.
2. **Change your runtime to use a GPU**:
   - Go to the top menu in Colab ➔ **Runtime** ➔ **Change runtime type** ➔ Select **GPU**.

3. **Follow the order of the notebooks**:

| Order | Notebook | Description |
|:-----:|:---------|:------------|
| 1 | [Data_exploration.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/KristoferLintonReid/DeepLearningMedicalImageTutorial2025/blob/main/Data_exploration.ipynb) | Explore the dataset, visualize examples, understand the data. |
| 2 | [Building_Models.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/KristoferLintonReid/DeepLearningMedicalImageTutorial2025/blob/main/Building_Models.ipynb) | Learn about different model building strategies (Radiomics, SimpleCNN, Contrastive models). |
| 3 | [Assesment](https://forms.gle/GCg7dHvZZAe8nrMW8) | Main graded exercise: choose a model, train it, evaluate it, and answer technical questions. |

---

## Instructions for the Exercise

- In the Assesment Google Form you will:
  - **Pick a model** from the strategies covered (Radiomics, SimpleCNN, Contrastive Learning) or implement your own.
  - **Train the model** on the PathMNIST dataset covered in Data Eploration and Building Models Notebooks.
  - **Answer technical questions** your model rational and technical questions will be used for grading.
  
Please read the instructions inside the `Exercise.ipynb` carefully!

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this exercise, you will be able to:

    Compare and select appropriate deep learning strategies (Radiomics, SimpleCNN, Contrastive models) based on the problem and dataset characteristics.

    Design and implement a model architecture tailored for medical image analysis.

    Understand the importance of key hyperparameters and optimization strategies.

    Critically assess model strengths and limitations in a medical context.

    Interpret evaluation metrics and explain which ones are most relevant for medical imaging tasks.

    Differentiate between radiomics-based methods, end-to-end deep learning models, and contrastive learning approaches.

    Identify challenges related to deep learning with small datasets and medical imaging specifics.
